## Overview
The United States flu vaccination rates are quite low (%%%). This poses a problem to general public health, especially considering the availability of vaccines and the effectiveness of flu vaccination. 

Using data from we [Drive Data](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/data/), we created a prediction model for whether or not an individual would inoculate with the flu vaccine.

## Data & Methods
The data comes from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS) and contains the following answers provided by the respondants:
- level of concern of H1N1 Vaccine
- 

"The NHFS was a list-assisted random-digit-dialing telephone survey of households, designed to monitor influenza immunization coverage in the 2009-10 season. The target population for the NHFS was all persons 6 months or older living in the United States at the time of the interview. Data from the NHFS were used to produce timely estimates of vaccination coverage rates for both the monovalent pH1N1 and trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines."

## Stakeholder
The Stakeholder is the CDC.  providing information and estimates, geared toward coordinating incentive campaigns

## Business proposal



## Next steps
