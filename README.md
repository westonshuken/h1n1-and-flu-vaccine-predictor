## Overview
The United States flu vaccination rates are quite low (%%%). This poses a problem to general public health, especially considering the availability of vaccines and the effectiveness of flu vaccination. 

Using data from we [Drive Data](https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/data/), we created a prediction model for whether or not an individual would inoculate with the flu vaccine.

## The Business Problem 
The goal is to know what the most effective behaviours of people are to get vaccinated against the H1N1 flu virus and the seasonal flu viruses, knowing the key factors affecting the behaviour and the motivations that encourage the citizens to get the vaccine, whether his/her education, age, employer affects their decision to get vaccinated or not. Also, if there is a health insurance, physician recommendation, presence of the chronical diseases and working in the health care sector. It also may be affected by the human behaviours whether one is conservative or not as touching face, meet others in large gathering, not wearing the mask and not washing hands.
The main purpose of this algorithm is classification, meaning that this model should be able to take in attributes of the National 2009 H1N1 Flu and Seasonal Flu Survey dataset that shows whether the survey respondent received the seasonal flu vaccine, or whether the respondent received the H1N1 flu vaccine. The effectiveness of this classification model will be measured by how well it predicts the vaccinated individual based on his/her behaviour and motivation characteristics.

## Analysis Questions 
-	Is the age a huge motivation for individual to be vaccinated?
-	Is the knowledge of the importance of the vaccine by the individual effective in his decision?
-	Are male or female more vaccinated?
-	Is the presence of chronical disease a factor pushing to be vaccinated?

## Data & Methods
The data comes from the National 2009 H1N1 Flu Survey (NHFS) and contains the following answers provided by the respondants:
- level of concern of H1N1 Vaccine
- 

"The NHFS was a list-assisted random-digit-dialing telephone survey of households, designed to monitor influenza immunization coverage in the 2009-10 season. The target population for the NHFS was all persons 6 months or older living in the United States at the time of the interview. Data from the NHFS were used to produce timely estimates of vaccination coverage rates for both the monovalent pH1N1 and trivalent seasonal influenza vaccines."

## Stakeholder
The Stakeholder is the CDC.  providing information and estimates, geared toward coordinating incentive campaigns
